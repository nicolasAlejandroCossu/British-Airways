# ✈️ British Airways Reviews Project: A Data Science Journey ✈️
I embarked on a data science journey using British Airways reviews to explore, clean, analyze, and create an interactive dashboard that provides actionable insights.
Workflow Overview:
### ⚙ Database Integration (MySQL): Imported CSV datasets into MySQL Workbench, connected via Python, and executed simple query to combine tables into a cohesive dataset.
### 🧹 Data Cleaning & EDA: Leveraged Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to:
 - Normalize variables.
 - Handle missing/duplicated values.
 - Detect anomalies and reclassify variables for smoother analysis.
### ✅ Exported Data: Cleaned data was exported to CSV and visualized in Tableau Public.
### 📊 Interactive Dashboard Features:
 - Average Ratings: Seat comfort, cabin staff, food service, etc.
 - Trends Over Time: Ratings from 2016 to 2023.
 - Geographical Analysis: World map of ratings by country.
 - Aircraft Insights: Ratings by aircraft type.
 - Recommendations: Percent of users recommending the airline.

### 📈 Growth & Future Plans:
This project deepened my expertise in MySQL, Python, Pandas, Tableau, and data visualization. Next steps include:
 - Correlation analysis between recommendations and ratings.
 - Building a machine learning model to predict customer satisfaction.

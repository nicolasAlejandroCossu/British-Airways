✈️ British Airways Reviews Project: A Data Science Journey ✈️
I embarked on a data science journey using British Airways reviews to explore, clean, analyze, and create an interactive dashboard that provides actionable insights.
Workflow Overview:
⚙ Database Integration (MySQL): Imported CSV datasets into MySQL Workbench, connected via Python, and executed simple query to combine tables into a cohesive dataset.
🧹 Data Cleaning & EDA: Leveraged Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to:
 ◼️ Normalize variables.
 ◼️ Handle missing/duplicated values.
 ◼️ Detect anomalies and reclassify variables for smoother analysis.
✅ Exported Data: Cleaned data was exported to CSV and visualized in Tableau Public.
📊 Interactive Dashboard Features:
 ◼️ Average Ratings: Seat comfort, cabin staff, food, etc.
 ◼️ Trends Over Time: Ratings from 2016 to 2023.
 ◼️ Geographical Analysis: World map of ratings by country.
 ◼️ Aircraft Insights: Ratings by aircraft type.
 ◼️ Recommendations: Percent of users recommending the airline.

📈 Growth & Future Plans:
This project deepened my expertise in MySQL, Python, Pandas, Tableau, and data visualization. Next steps include:
 ◼️ Correlation analysis between recommendations and ratings.
 ◼️ Building a machine learning model to predict customer satisfaction.
